# Rectangle Area Comparison

This project is a simple Java application that compares the areas of two rectangles. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions (length and width) of two rectangles, and the program calculates and displays the area of each rectangle. It then determines and displays which rectangle has the larger area.

## Project Structure

- `src/entities/Retangulo.java`: Defines the `Retangulo` class with attributes for length and width, and a method to calculate the area.
- `src/Main.java`: The entry point of the application, which calls the main method of the `Program` class.
- `src/application/Program.java`: Contains the main logic of the application, including user input and area comparison.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac src/entities/Retangulo.java src/application/Program.java src/Main.java
